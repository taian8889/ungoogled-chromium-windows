            ## 🎯 x64 Extended Timeout Build
            
            This is an extended timeout build of ungoogled-chromium x64 architecture.
            
            ### ✅ Extended Timeout Settings:
            - Job timeout: 10 hours (600 minutes)
            - No step timeout limits
            - Build.py timeout: 6 hours (360 minutes)
            
            ### 📊 Previous Results:
            - Original timeout: 3.5 hours (failed)
            - First fix: 5h 50m (GitHub Actions timeout)
            - This build: 10 hours maximum
            
            ### 🔍 Build Details:
            - **Architecture**: x64 only
            - **Version**: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
            - **Max Build Time**: 10 hours
            - **Status**: Extended timeout test build
            
            ### 🎯 Success Criteria:
