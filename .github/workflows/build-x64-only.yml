            ## 🎯 x64 Test Build
            
            This is a test build of ungoogled-chromium x64 architecture only.
            
            ### ✅ Fixed Issues:
            - Extended build timeout from 3.5h to 6h
            - Removed forced interruption on timeout
            - Added proper GitHub Actions timeout configuration
            
            ### 📦 Build Details:
            - **Architecture**: x64 only
            - **Version**: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
            - **Build Time**: ~6-8 hours
            - **Status**: Test build to verify timeout fix
            
            ### 🔍 Next Steps:
            If this build succeeds, we'll proceed with full multi-architecture build.
