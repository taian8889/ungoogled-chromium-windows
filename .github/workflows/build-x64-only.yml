            ## 🎯 x64 Extended 12-Hour Build
            
            This is an extended timeout build of ungoogled-chromium x64 architecture.
            
            ### ✅ Maximum Timeout Settings:
            - Job timeout: 12 hours (720 minutes)
            - No step timeout limits (completely removed)
            - Build.py timeout: 6 hours (360 minutes)
            
            ### 📊 Timeout Evolution:
            - Original: 3.5 hours → ❌ Failed
            - First fix: 5h 50m → ❌ GitHub Actions timeout
            - Second fix: 10 hours → ❌ Still not enough
            - This build: 12 hours → 🎯 Maximum effort!
            
            ### 🔍 Build Details:
            - **Architecture**: x64 only
            - **Version**: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
            - **Max Build Time**: 12 hours (half a day!)
            - **Status**: Maximum timeout test build
            
            ### 🎉 Success Criteria:
            If this build completes successfully, we have solved the timeout issue completely and can proceed with fingerprint protection integration!
            
            ### 💪 Why 12 Hours Should Work:
            - Most complex Chromium builds complete within 8-10 hours
            - This gives us a 20-50% safety margin
            - Accounts for any system slowdowns or resource contention
