# Build Trigger

This file triggers the build with fixed timeout settings.

## Fixed Issues:
- Extended build timeout from 3.5h to 6h
- Removed forced interruption on timeout
- Added GitHub Actions timeout configuration

## Build Details:
- Version: v139.0.7258.127-fixed-timeout
- Architectures: x64, x86, ARM64
- Expected completion: 6-8 hours
- Trigger time: 2025-08-16 14:06 UTC

## Changes Applied:
1. build.py: timeout=6*60*60 (6 hours)
2. main.yml: timeout-minutes: 360 for all jobs
3. All build steps: timeout-minutes: 350

Build should complete successfully without timeout interruption.
