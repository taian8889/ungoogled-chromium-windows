Trigger extended build workflow - 10 hours timeout
Created: 2025-08-17 10:10 UTC
Purpose: Force GitHub to recognize the new workflow file

This file is created to trigger GitHub Actions to refresh and recognize the new build-x64-only-extended.yml workflow file.

If you still don't see the "Run workflow" button:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub to process
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check if Actions are enabled in repository settings
4. Try accessing the direct workflow URL:
